        <h4> Sarees - Elegant Form of Indian Attire </h4>
        <p> Looking to buy saree for upcoming festival - Navratri, Durga Pooja & Diwali 2020? Then you have arrived at the right
             place. As we all know that the grandeur and elegance that a simple saree can radiate is far too enchanting 
             for any other ensemble to match. As plush as sarees are, they don’t have to be restricted to grand occasions. 
             So, go on and explore this nine-yard wonder online. Flipkart brings to you an expansive range of sarees like designer 
             sarees, fancy sarees, party wear sarees, traditional sarees, and many more. Whether you have a wedding to attend or a holy 
             ceremony, we have just what you need and more. Top brands like Ishin, Ratnavati, Saara, Kyrila, Triveni, Tribes India,
              Mimosa, Manvaa, Pisara, Vardan Prints, Aika, Clemira, Anand, Diya Creation, etc., have an assortment of printed, embroidered
               and woven saris for you to choose from. Up your ethnic style quotient with saris from our 
            online store. Add them to your exquisite saree collection and make heads turn when you wear them for different
             events and occasions.</p>

             <h4>Styling Tips For Sarees </h4>
             <p> Styling your saree is not as hard as you think. If you are heading to your best friend’s wedding and your silk saree
                 happens to be royal blue, you can add a pair of gold earrings and a pair of thin gold bangles to complete the ensemble. 
                 Wearing a pair of gold-toned heels is always a bonus. Make sure to not add any more bling to your outfit as it may spoil the entire
                  look. If you wear a saree with minimal embroidered and woven patterns, then you can don a gold necklace and a pair of thin 
                  bangles for a complete look. Make sure to never wear a chunky pair of earrings if you are going to wear a heavy necklace
                   as well. Always opt for either one.</p>

                   <h4> Drape Your Saree Stylishly </h4>
                   <p> To give you a heads-up of the different saree-draping styles, we have listed a few of them. Some of them are different 
                    saree-draping styles from different regions of India. You can check them out and try the one that you feel will make 
                    you look like a diva:<br>
                    Maharashtrian Style: There are several Bollywood songs where the featured actresses have draped their 
                    sarees in this style. You can check out the song “Pinga” from the movie Bajirao Mastani to have a 
                    better idea about this style. If you want to drape your saree in this style, then you will have to use

                <h4> A Little History to This Much-celebrated Indian Attire</h4>
                <p>The saree is one of the most elegant forms of Indian attire. Unlike any other garment, this nine-yard wonder brings out the beauty of a woman
                     and is a must-have attire in your wardrobe. This is one of the oldest forms of unstitched drape clothing to exist on this planet. The history of drapery clothing similar to the saree (साड़ी) dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization during 2800- 1800 B.C. The word 'saree' evolved from the Sanskrit word 'Saatikaa' which literally means women's attire. The saree is an elegant, sensuous and glamorous piece of clothing for women. They are also a canvas for printers and weavers to create artistic weaves, embroideries and jewelled embellishments. The saree is an incredibly versatile attire that hugs the contours of a woman’s body in such an aesthetic manner. Whether young or old, any woman can don a
                     saree and look astounding. Unlike any other attire, a saree is the only traditional outfit that allows you to style it in various ways.  </p>
                     <h4> A Perfect Balance of Style and Culture </h4>
                     <p> Indians were always good with their hands. When it came to hand-printed or handmade embroidered detailing, Indians were always the winner. In the olden 
                        days, women who wore fabrics made out of silk, muslin and cotton, were considered extraordinarily beautiful. Fabrics were
                         specially woven for festive occasions and religious ceremonies that acquired specific names. Back then, the Indian literature
                          prose and poems were also inspired by how ravishing and elegant the attires worn by the upper classes were. Some historical 
                          records say the silks and muslins back then were supremely expensive and they were sold to the ends of the world that included the people who lived around the Mediterranean Sea. Depending upon the texture and origin of the fabrics, many names were given to these fabrics. For instance, Chinnavastra was a fabric similar to Chinese silk. Kausheya was silk made from the most exquisite cocoons. Tasara silk, now known as Tassar or Tussar silk, was made using a special kind of shuttle. Moreover, the Moghuls wore exquisite quality brocades that
                         were described as ‘Golden Dream’ or Kinkhwab. The Europeans, back then, were known for importing this fabric and calling it Kinkob. To this day, the brocade is known by this name in most European countries.</p>
                         <h4> Traditional yet Ravishing</h4>
                         <p> Did you know that the pallu and the border are the most important parts of a sari? These parts of the sari are usually adorned with either zari or additional strips of cloth and tassels so that they don’t get crushed.
                             A sari can be made of cotton, different kinds of silk, georgette, chiffon, polyester, and so on. The Kanchipuram silk saree is a favourite amongst
                              people in South India. Whereas, the Banarasi silk saree is known amongst brides-to-be for its alluring look and soft texture. Georgette sarees are lightweight, elegant and can be worn on a regular basis. Chiffon saris have a slightly textured feel to them as they have been stretched both ways while getting manufactured.
                               They are translucent and remarkably fashionable. Cotton sarees are breathable, soft and comfortable to wear. Most states in India have 
                               their own versions of cotton saris. They say that cotton and the art of weaving it into the fabric came to India from the Mesopotamian civilisation. 
                               Furthermore, Chanderi silk is another popular material that is a blend of cotton and silk. Well known for its shiny and sheer texture, Chanderi silk is a favourite amongst 
                               women in India. Apart from these, the kota saris, jamdani weave saris and tissue sarees are worn by women of different states in India till today.</p>

                         <h4> Things to Consider When Looking for Sarees Online (साड़ी शॉपिंग गाइड)</h4>

The material you choose for a saree is more important than you think it is. Some fabrics suit some and some don’t. They are available in so many materials and they each have their own characteristics. However, not every material suits everyone. Some fabrics may look flattering on some people while that same fabric may look unflattering on another person. This may depend upon different criteria, such as skin tone, body type, etc. 
                           </p> 
                           <p> Season <br>India has different weather zones. When looking to buy a saree online, you must take into account the weather in your area. If you are staying in a cool place, you can opt for a velvet saree so that it keeps you warm. If you are in a tropical state, you can opt for a cotton saree that won’t let the heat get to you. 
                            </p>
                            <p>  Work on the Saree <br>  There are different types of embellishments you can find on sarees, such as embroidery, mirror work, zardozi, stone work, gotta patti, meenakari, kundan, resham, beads and many more. While shopping for designer sarees online, you can find them with these embellishments. Pick the one that fancies you the most. 
                            </p>
                            <p> Pattern<br>Sarees come in a wide range of patterns. To mention a few, they are available in printed, abstract, animal, checkered, chevron, floral, embellished, solid, stripes and textured patterns. Depending upon your body shape and the purpose of the purchase, you can accordingly choose one that suits you the best in every way possible.
                            </p>
                            <p> Budget <br>   One of the most important factors to consider when shopping for sarees online is the budget. Sarees are available in different price ranges. A quick research online will guide you sarees that are within your budget.  </p>

                            <h4>Style Your Saree with the Right Blouse </h4>
                            <p> You don't need to do a lot of brainstorming when it comes to styling sarees. However, people who love wearing sarees also know the fact that well-fitting blouses can do wonders. Hence, instead of simply opting for a blouse that you feel will look good on you, you can take the wise route and select one as per your body type. You can check the points below: <br>
                                Hourglass Body Type: If you have such a body type, opt for a blouse that has a boat-neck or wide-neck design. Such a blouse with half sleeves can accentuate your ensemble. <br>
                                Apple-shaped Body Type: If you have this body type, then try not to opt for a sleeveless blouse, as it can make your arms and shoulder look wider. You can opt for one that comes with 3/4th sleeves. <br>
                                Pear-shaped Body Type: If your body is pear-shaped, then you can opt for a backless blouse.<br> However, a backless blouse with such a saree might not look too classy. So, you can instead opt for one that has a deep-cut design on the back. <br>
                                Slim Body Type: You can select sleeveless blouses and even full-sleeved blouses. <br>
                                The Pattern of Plain Sarees with Designer Blouses<br> Plain or woven sarees will always be in style, but hand-painted and geometric-print sarees make a case for themselves with their eccentricity. Anyone who loves a good saree knows that a handful of options just won’t do. Indulge yourself. We bring you plain sarees with designer blouses which are adorned with checks, embellishments, embroidery work, floral print, digital prints, polka dots, stripes, and even graphic prints – all these at varying prices to suit different budgets.
                             </p>
                             <h4> Sarees Highlight Women’s Best Features </h4>
                             <p> When a saree is draped, it wraps itself around the woman, highlighting her curves and the shape of her body. Many women even claim that sarees tend to make their bodies look better as sarees make them look slim and toned. And when women adorn their ears, arms, and hair with jewellery and flowers, they add to charm of sarees. Also, the most unique feature of sarees is that they suit all body types. So, the next time you have a social event coming up, buy your sarees online - to add to your ensemble, or to start your collection of finest sarees. </p>
                             <h4>Tips on How to Look Slim in Sarees </h4>
                             <p>How to look slim in sarees you ask? There are quite a few ways to solve this problem. As we know that sarees have been one of the most versatile pieces of clothing in the world, they are also not that hard to style. With the new trends hitting the market off late, wearing your sarees and looking slim is child’s play. <br>
                                Firstly, make sure your saree is made from a light fabric. Something with intricate embroidery will not be as lightweight as a georgette or a chiffon printed saree. The thinner and lighter the fabric, the better it is to drape it around your body. You will find brands like Yashika, Saara, Pisara, VJ Fashions, Crally, etc., that offer you a vast collection of crepe, chiffon and georgette sarees. <br>
                                The second tip is to choose dark colours. Dark colours make a big difference when you want to look slim. You can either choose a solid coloured saree or a printed one. If you go for the printed option, make sure the prints are light and elongated. Vertical prints do a better job of making you look slim rather than horizontal prints.<br>
                                The third tip is to choose sarees that have thin borders. Thick borders with embroidery and embellishments may look glamorous and eye-catching, but when it comes to looking thin, then you must know that thin borders are the real deal. The fourth and the last point is long-sleeved blouses make you look thinner as compared to sleeveless blouses.
                             </p>
                             <h4>Why Should I Buy Sarees Online? </h4>
                             <p> The last time when I went saree-shopping with my mom, it took her a good couple of hours to go through half the sarees that she thought would look good on her. And, being the impatient guy that I am, I got cranky. So, if you’re someone like me, then you should definitely consider buying sarees online as you can choose and compare a host of sarees easily without having to waste a ton of time.
